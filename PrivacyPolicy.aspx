            <p> e2aforums supports middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms

              the archiving of your communications and other e2aforums activity by a third party
              for compliance purposes. Content distributed through e2aforums sharing features
              and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information
              outside of LinkedIn. For example, when you post content to a e2aforums Group that
              is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor,
              may be displayed in search engine results. Also, if you have bound your e2aforums
              account to your Twitter ,Facebook or Google+ account, you can easily share content
              from e2aforums to Twitter to Facebook,or Google+ in accordance with your applicable
              account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective Twitter Google+
              or Facebook policies. Further, e2aforums allows third parties to look-up profile
              information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first
              and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below). </p>
            <p> Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload
              certain information in your e2aforums contacts onto their own service. If you choose
              to share your e2aforums contacts, you will be granting your third party provider
              the right to store, access, disclose and use your e2aforums contacts in the ways
              described in such third party's terms and privacy policy. </p>
            <h4>2.7. Third Parties Using e2aforums Platform Services</h4>
            <p>We work with developers to build Platform Applications using <font class="opcity">e2aforums</font> developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you. If you have given a Platform Application access to your e2aforums account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections.</p>
            <p>We collaborate with and allow third parties to use e2aforums’s developer platform
              to offer services and functionality in conjunction with LinkedIn. These third-party
              developers have either negotiated an agreement to use e2aforums platform technology
              or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications
              (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin
              terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal
              information you provide to LinkedIn. If you choose to use a Platform Application,
              you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement
              of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application,
              please visit your settings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission
              granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform
              Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information
              about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information
              to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the “Turn on/off
              data sharing with third-party applications” control in the “Groups, Companies, and
              Applications” tab under settings.</p>
            <h4>2.8. Polls and Surveys</h4>
            <p>We conduct our own surveys and polls and also help third parties do this type of
              research. Your participation in surveys or polls is up to you. You may also opt
              out of getting invitations to participate in surveys.</p>
            <p> Polls and Surveys may be conducted by e2aforums, Members, or third parties. Some
              third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your
              answers in the poll. e2aforums LinkedIn or third parties may follow up with you
              via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail
              messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in
              surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information,
              you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the
              incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives
              and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this
              information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent
              to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the
              poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.e2aforums
