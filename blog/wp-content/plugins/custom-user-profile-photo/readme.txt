Add a customized User Profile photo to a WordPress user profile.

== Description ==

A more flexible way to attach and display a photo for a WordPress user profile.

Some users might not have or want to have a gravatar account or other universal avatar account. They simply may want to use a one-time specified photo to represent them on your WordPress site. This plugin solves that use case.

With the ability to upload a photo to a user profile via the WordPress Media Uploader or by specifying an external URL to an image, your users and/or authors can have a personalized photo specific to your website.*

This plugin will add a custom set of fields to the user profile page which will allow for the use of a custom profile photo.

You can add/change/edit uploaded photos directly from the user profile page. The external option allows you to provide a URL to the external image or remove it.

**As of v0.4**, the plugin now overrides the get_avatar() hook found in most WordPress themes. 

Simply go to the users section and select a user or select "Your Profile" depending on your permission level. The new fields are added to the bottom of the user profile page. Choose which type of photo you want to use. Upload an image or add an external url. Then press the Update Profile button.

If you require a customized approach or your theme does not support the get_avatar() hook, use the example below.

To retrieve the photo on the front-end use the following example on your template page(s):
`<?php
	// Retrieve The Post's Author ID
	$user_id = get_the_author_meta('ID');
	// Set the image size. Accepts all registered images sizes and array(int, int)
	$size = 'thumbnail';

	// Get the image URL using the author ID and image size params
	$imgURL = get_cupp_meta($user_id, $size);

	// Print the image on the page
	echo '<img src="'. $imgURL .'" alt="">';
?>`
You will need to place the code above in each area of your theme where you wish to add and retrieve your theme's custom avatar image. This can include but is not limited to single.php, page.php, and comments.php.

*Future Updates to this plugin include allowing other roles to access this feature, a settings page to allow a custom default image and other options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `custom-user-profile-photo` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php get_cupp_meta($user_id, $size); ?>` in your templates

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can upload and manage these images? =

Currently, only a user with the upload_files capability can use this option. 
Editors and Admins can upload and edit files.
Authors can only upload files.
Subscribers and Contributors cannot do either so an Admin will need to do this for them.

= I installed the plugin but I want to customize the output and placement of the image. Is this possible? = 

Yes, you can still customize the output by using the get_cupp_meta() function. Please reference the code snippet below or on the Description tab. 
`<?php echo get_cupp_meta($user_ID, $size); ?>`
Where the $user_ID is the users ID number and the size is a registered image size like 'thumbnail' or an array like `array(50,50)`.
